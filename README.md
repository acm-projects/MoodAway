# MoodAway
A lot of people tend to express their emotions by journaling. This online journal will run a sentiment analysis on your journal entry and according to the mood detected, methods will be suggested to help better your mood! 
​
# MVP
- User will be able to write a journal entry for each day
- Once the sentiment analysis is run, according to the result, the user is allowed to confirm the sentiment predicted 
- The user must answer follow up questions on the emotion detected
- Based on answers, recommended articles/tips will be provided to improve your mood
- The user will have access to a page which displays the days in which a journal entry was written (calendar page) and they can access any past journal entry
- The user can rate each day out of 10: a statistics page will display this information in a bar graph/line graph for every month 
- Color of the bar/line graph according to the rating (green: 8-10, yellow: 4-7, red: 0-3) 
​
# Stretch Goals 
- Rate method suggested so that if it does not work well, this method won’t be recommended again.
- Option to write multiple journal entries each day
- Understand patterns in mood changes
- Therapy suggestions according to changing moods
​
# Potential pages required 
- Journal entry page
- Questionnaire page 
- Recommendations (articles and tips) page 
- Calendar page
- Statistics page 
- Journal entry rating page
